# meme-downloader

Place the file in a directory where you want your all memes to be stored.
Run the python file. That's it.

<b>Warning:</b>
*After running the program for the first time, It will create some folders and a file called 'pages.json' in the same directory. Don't edit that file manually or it may cause the program to crash.


<b>Features:</b>
1) Add as many facebook pages add you want
2) You can set how many memes should be downloaded each time
3) Seperate folder for new downloaded memes. You can clear it anytime.
4) MemesByPage folder which contains all the memes in folders named by the page names
5) Broken downloads will be automatically removed
6) You can view the list of the pages currently used by the program to download memes
7) You can remove one or more pages easily, but you will have to add one by one



I don't know if it is illegal or not to scrap facebook pages like this. If you know this is illegal, you can inform me about that
